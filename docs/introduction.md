# Introduction

*Neodoc* is both a command line parser and command line parser generator. It
has two unique properties that sets it apart from competitors in that it (1)
is able to derive a command line parser from the help text (a la docopt) and
(2) provide a pattern-guided match on argv &mdash; akin to a regular expressions
engine for command line parsing.
