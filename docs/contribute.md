# Contribute

If you have any issues or possible improvements please file them as
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/felixschl/neodoc/issues). Pull requests are
encouraged.

I understand purescript may not have been the best choice to foster
contributions in a JS setting, but contributions can take many forms other than
code that is of equivalent value: documentation, designing features, pointing
out issues or writing tests, to name a few.
